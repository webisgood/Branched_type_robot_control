# Trajectory Planning and Control for a branched type robot

In this project I was required to go through various research articles and books to gain a decent understanding of the rigid body dynamics as modeled in terms of screw-theory.

Then, I used the concepts that I have learnt to implement a numerical Inverse Kinematic Solver for a simple 2R robot in MATLAB. This is crucial as it can easily be used to find the time-series of joint displacements required to trace out a particular trajectory.

Later, I have modeled a spatial(3D) tree robot in MATLAB code and devised the inverse kinematic solver using the same principles. Finally, I tested the robustness of the solver for different parameter values.
